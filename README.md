### ‚ú® Project Overview

**AquaScan** was founded on February 30, 2025, and aims to offer a cutting-edge product that monitors water level and impurity presence in real-time, providing crucial data for water management, whether for residential, industrial, or environmental use. The AquaScan device is an IoT system that operates in water tanks and monitors:

* **Water pH**
* **Turbidity (transparency)**
* **Water level**
* **Estimated consumption (flow)**

Data is sent via SMS with the help of an Arduino and a GSM module.

The website serves as a portal to introduce the company, detail the product, its functionalities, and technologies, as well as provide contact channels for potential clients and partners. This project represents the application of web development concepts, interface design, and group project management, aiming to simulate a real-world work environment for creating a complete digital solution.
